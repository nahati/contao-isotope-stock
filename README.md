## Configuration

Your settings can be individual per product-type and per product. In backend's shop-configuration you can activate the attributes you want to use for a given product-type:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>inventory_status</td>
    <td>not for sale</td>
    <td>set by backend user if applicable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>available</td>
    <td>default</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>reserved</td>
    <td>system set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>soldout</td>
    <td>system set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>quantity</td>
    <td>number of items available for sale</td>
    <td>set by backend user, modified by system</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>minQuantityPerOrder</td>
    <td>minimum number of product items allowed for an order</td>
    <td>set by backend user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>maxQuantityPerOrder</td>
    <td>maximum number of product items allowed for an order</td>
    <td>set by backend user</td>
  </tr>
</table>

All attributes can be changed by a backend user.

**Configuring just the gallery feature (without HandleLimitedEditions)**

You may activate only `inventory_status`. Then only the options `not for sale` and `available` are used and there will not be any further stock-management for this product-type.
Use this, if you just want to want to combine shop and gallery.

**Configuring limited editions**

If you have limited editions, activate `quantity` to enable stock-management for this product-type. Then you MUST activate `inventory_status`, too. (Othwerwise an exception will be thrown).

For products with no limit keep the `quantity` field empty. Then there will be no stock-management for this product.

**Recommended additional configuration for limited editions**

You may want to receive a notification when a product is overbought (this can happen if there are concurring updates simultaneously, e.g. another order by another user).
Then you need to do this as well:

Add a notification of type `change order status`. Under _shop configuration_ add an order status `Overbought` (mind the exact spelling!) and link this notification to it.

**Configuring limited orders**

If you want to limit the quantity per order, activate `minQuantityPerOrder` and/or `maxQuantityPerOrder` for this product-type.
Make sure to set the maximum equal to or greater than the minimum! (Othwerwise an exception will be thrown).

For products with no such limit keep the respective field(s) empty.
